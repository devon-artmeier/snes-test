# Sonic The Hedgehog SNES Port

This is an unfinished (and cancelled) Sonic The Hedgehog SNES port I was working on while I was learning to program for the SNES. As such, the code here 
is most definitely amateurish and not very optimal. This is here for archival purposes only. I ended up cancelling the whole thing due to lack of motivation 
to continue working on it (and lack of motivation to continue learning SNES development as well).

## How To Build

The source requires the [ARM9 fork of the bass assembler](https://github.com/ARM9/bass) for assembling.

To build he ROM, run "\_build\_.bat" in the src folder.
