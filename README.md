# SNES Test

This is a basic SNES test I made while learning to develop for it, by porting over code from Sonic The Hedgehog. As such, the code here 
is most definitely amateurish and not very optimal. This is here for archival purposes only. I ended up cancelling it due to lack of motivation 
to continue learning SNES development.

## How To Build

The source requires the [ARM9 fork of the bass assembler](https://github.com/ARM9/bass) for assembling.

To build the ROM, run "\_build\_.bat" in the src folder.
